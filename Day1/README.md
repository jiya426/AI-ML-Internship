# Day 1 – Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

## Objective
To clean and prepare raw data for machine learning.

## Dataset Used
Titanic Dataset

## Steps Performed
- Explored dataset using info() and describe()
- Handled missing values (Age, Embarked)
- Dropped irrelevant columns (Cabin)
- Encoded categorical variables (Sex, Embarked)
- Detected and removed outliers using IQR method
- Applied feature scaling using StandardScaler

## Key Learnings
- Importance of handling missing values
- Difference between label encoding and one-hot encoding
- Outlier detection using boxplots
- Normalization vs standardization

## Outcome
The dataset was successfully cleaned and prepared for machine learning modeling.
