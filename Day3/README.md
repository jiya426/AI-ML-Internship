# Day 3 – Linear Regression

## Objective
To implement simple and multiple linear regression models.

## Dataset Used
Housing Dataset

## Steps Performed
- Performed train-test split
- Converted categorical variables using encoding
- Trained Linear Regression model
- Predicted house prices
- Evaluated model using MAE, MSE, and R² score
- Interpreted regression coefficients
- Performed residual analysis

## Key Learnings
- Understanding regression assumptions
- Interpreting R² score
- Difference between MAE and MSE
- Feature impact on target variable

## Outcome
Built a working regression model to predict house prices and evaluated its performance.
