# 🌳 Decision Trees and Random Forests

### AI & ML Internship – Task 5

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on implementing **tree-based machine learning models** including:

* Decision Tree Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier

The objective is to understand how tree-based algorithms work, analyze overfitting, compare model performance, and interpret feature importance.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Train a Decision Tree model
* Visualize the decision tree
* Control overfitting using tree depth
* Train a Random Forest model
* Compare performance of both models
* Interpret feature importance
* Evaluate models using cross-validation

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Graphviz
* Jupyter Notebook

## ⚙️ Implementation Steps

1. Imported and preprocessed the dataset
2. Performed train-test split
3. Trained Decision Tree Classifier
4. Visualized decision tree using Graphviz
5. Analyzed overfitting by adjusting `max_depth`
6. Trained Random Forest Classifier
7. Compared model accuracy
8. Interpreted feature importance
9. Evaluated using cross-validation

## 📊 Model Evaluation

Models were evaluated using:

* Accuracy Score
* Confusion Matrix
* Cross-validation Score

### 🔍 Observations

* Decision Trees can overfit if depth is not controlled.
* Random Forest improves performance by reducing variance using bagging.
* Feature importance helps identify the most influential variables.
