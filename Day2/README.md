# Day 2 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Objective
To understand the dataset using statistics and visualizations.

## Dataset Used
Titanic Dataset

## Steps Performed
- Generated summary statistics (mean, median, std)
- Created histograms for numerical features
- Used boxplots to detect outliers
- Built correlation matrix
- Created pairplots to study relationships
- Identified patterns and trends in survival data

## Key Insights
- Female passengers had higher survival rates
- First-class passengers survived more
- Fare distribution was highly right-skewed
- Survival is influenced by passenger class and gender

## Outcome
Gained deeper understanding of feature relationships and data patterns before modeling.
